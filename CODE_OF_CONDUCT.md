# Code of Conduct

Nullbit1 is a small security-focused org. We deal with low-level code, malware and sometimes ugly parts of the internet. That is not an excuse to behave like a jerk.

This document is intentionally short.

## Be decent

When you interact in issues, PRs, discussions or chats under the Nullbit1 umbrella:

- attack ideas, not people;
- no harassment, doxxing or personal threats;
- no hate speech, slurs or discrimination towards any group;
- keep criticism technical and specific, not ad hominem;
- assume good faith until someone clearly proves the opposite.

You can be direct, blunt and even a bit sarcastic. You cannot be abusive.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- all GitHub repos under the `Nullbit1` organisation;
- any other place that is explicitly linked from those repos as an official communication channel.

## Reporting

If someone crosses the line:

1. Take a screenshot or copy links to the relevant messages.
2. Report it via GitHub (block/report user if needed).
3. Optionally, open a short issue in the affected repo or ping the org owners in private so we can step in.

We reserve the right to remove comments, lock threads and ban people from the org repos if they consistently ignore these rules.

## Consequences

Depending on severity, reactions can include:

- a friendly reminder;
- a warning in public or private;
- removal of comments or issues;
- temporary or permanent ban from contributing.

This is a security org, not a daycare. Stay sharp, stay respectful.
