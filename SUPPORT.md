# Support

Nullbit1 is a small security lab, not a company with an SLA.

That said, here is how to get help in a way that is most likely to get an answer.

## 1. Read the docs

Before opening an issue:

- read the project's README and any `docs/` it might have;
- check existing issues (open and closed);
- search for your error message.

If something is unclear in the docs, that is already a valid issue.

## 2. Use GitHub issues

For most things, use issues in the **specific repo**:

- **Bug reports** → use the "Bug report" template.
- **Feature requests** → use the "Feature request" template.
- **Questions / usage help** → either use the "Question" template (if present) or clearly mark the issue title with `[question]`.

Please keep one topic per issue.

## 3. What to include

The more concrete information you provide, the easier it is to help:

- which project and version you use;
- OS / kernel / compiler / runtime;
- how you built the tool (commands, flags);
- exact error messages and logs, ideally as text, not screenshots;
- what you already tried.

"Doesn't work" without details is likely to be ignored.

## 4. What you should not expect

- No guaranteed response time.
- No "do my homework / full malware analysis for me" type of support.
- No debugging of random unrelated projects.

We focus on the tools that live in this org.

If you want to discuss ideas more freely, check the READMEs of individual projects — some of them may link to chats or Discord servers where maintainers hang out.
